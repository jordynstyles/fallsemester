            <p>ENGL 4714</p>

            <h2>Class Description</h2>
            <p>Advanced Poetry is my capstone course for my creative writing degree. In the course, we read and analyze poetry from established poets including Divya Victor and Sharif Solmaz, and write our own poems. The bulk of the class however is dedicated to workshops. During workshop, everyone brings poems that they've written and we discuss them as a class, giving the writer notes on what they've done well and what could be improved.</p>

            <h2>Professor</h2>
            <p>Dr. Janine Joseph</p>

            <h2>About the Professor</h2>
            <p>Dr. Janine Joseph is a poet and librettist originally from the Philippines. She earned her B.A. from the University of California, Riverside, her M.F.A. from New York University, and her Ph.D. from the University of Houston. Her principal research areas include creative writing, poetry and politics, libretti,undocumented immigration and immigration literatures, undocupoetics, and creative nonfiction.</p>

            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <p>Although I wouldn't consider myself a poet, I truly believe that Dr. Joseph's class has set me up for success. Because of the implementation of "wellspring texts," which Dr. Joseph describes as "self-selected resources to inspire original metaphors, image systems, characters, new worlds, and specialized vocabularies," I feel like I have more direction than I would have had otherwise. AS a result, I'm having much more fun writing these poems than I expected.</p>
