            <h2>Class Title</h2>
            <p>ENGL 4814</p>

            <h2>Class Description</h2>
            <p>Developing Intelligent Content is an elective class I'm taking for my professional technical writing degree. In this course, we learn how to create content that may be adjusted, reused, and interacted with on multiple platforms. We do this my exploring the roles metadata, structured authoring, content management systems, and A.I. play in the process of content creation.</p>

            <h2>Professor</h2>
            <p>Dr. Carlos Evia</p>

            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <p>Like many of my classes this semester, I wasn't sure what to expect going into Developing Intelligent Content. But after just a few weeks, I can definitively say it's my favorite class this semester. While I entered the class with a little experience since I write articles for a few on-campus magazines, I feel like my knowledge and ability in the subject has already grown considerably. Although a lot of the things we discuss feel intimidating at first---specifically creating websites and working in HTML---the assignments are so fun and creative that I find myself feeling excited to work through my struggles so I can achieve the final product.</p>
