            <h2>Class Title</h2>
            <p>ENGL 4824</p>

            <h2>Class Description</h2>
            <p>Science Writing is an elective class I'm taking for my professional technical writing degree. In the class, we learn how to understand the writings of natural and social sciences and transform the information we learn into more digestible content for the general public.</p>

            <h2>Professor</h2>
            <p>Dr. Bruce McComiskey</p>

            <h2>About the Professor</h2>
            <p>Dr. Bruce McComiskey is a professor of Rhetoric and Writing in the English program originally from Massachusetts. He earned his BS in English Education from Illinois State University, his MA in English Rhetoric and Composition from Illinois State University, and his PhD in English Rhetoric and Composition from Purdue University. His principal research areas include ancient rhetorics (classical and non-western), modern rhetorical theory, composition pedagogy, composition history, and English studies. </p>

            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <p>I didn't expect to be taking a science class this far into my English degree(s), and yet, I ended up in this one. I went into this class with a lot of reservations. While I don't believe I'm especially bad at science classes, I don't think I'm especially good either. On top of that, Science Writing is the highest level class I've taken at Virginia Tech so far. Luckily for me, it hasn't been nearly as bad as I anticipated. Dr. McComiskey is a very laid-back professor, and I've been having a lot of fun incorporating scientific research into my writing assignments. It's so much different than my other English classes, but in that way, it's also a breath of fresh air.</p>
