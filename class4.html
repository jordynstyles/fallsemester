            <h2>Class Title</h2>
            <p>ENGL 2844</p>

            <h2>Class Description</h2>
            <p>I added Professional Technical Writing as a major at the end of spring semester last year, and this required class is the introduction to the subject. In this class, we develop skills in problem solving and decision making, audience analysis, document design, usability, and inclusive and ethnical documentation.</p>

            <h2>Professor</h2>
            <p>Dr. Sherri Craig</p>

            <h2>About the Professor</h2>
            <p>Dr. Sherri Craig is a professor of English in the Rhetoric and Writing program from Arizona. She earned her BA in English from Northern Arizona University, her MA in Literacy, Technology, and Professional Writing from Northern Arizona, and her PhD in Rhetoric and Composition from Purdue University. Her principal research areas include writing across the curriculum, writing program administration, Black rhetorics, critical pedagogy, and diversity in higher education.</p>

            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <p>It's been an interesting experience for me taking this introduction to professional technical writing class alongside higher level tech writing classes. Because it acts as more of a survey course, right now, I don't find it to be as compelling as my classes that are more specialized. That said, I do still enjoy this class. Dr. Craig is an exceptional professor and everything we're learning to do feels practical and widely applicable. I believe Dr. Craig is providing me with a great foundation to succeed in this field.</p>

            <h2>My Rating</h2>
            <p class="rating">B</p>
