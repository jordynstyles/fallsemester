            <h2>Class Title</h2>
            <p>ENGL 3814</p>

            <h2>Class Description</h2>
            <p>Creating User Documentation is an elective class I'm taking for my professional technical writing degree. In this asynchronous course, we learn about the three pillars of user documentation: procedures, processes, and narrative, and how to utilize them to construct useful, quality user documentation.</p>

            <h2>Professor</h2>
            <p>Dr. Sidouane Patcha Lum</p>

            <h2>About the Professor</h2>
            <p>Dr. Sidouane Patcha-Lum is an instructor of professional technical writing from Buea, Cameroon. She earned her BSe in Journalism and Mass Communication from the University of Buea, her MS in Rhetoric and Technical Communication from Michigan Technological University, and her PhD in Rhetoric and Composition from the University of Texas at El Paso. Her principal research areas include user experience, visual methodologies, composition, participatory action research, technical and professional writing, and cultural rhetorics/feminism and public life.</p>

            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <p>I am ambivalent about this course. On one hand, I went into the class with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. I didn't expect to find learning about and writing user documentation very interesting, but now four weeks into the course, that couldn't be further from the truth. At the same time however, I do believe my excitement for the class is severely diminished because it is completely asynchronous. MOst of our work so far has just been reading the textbook and writing our responses to the text on discussion boards, which can get boring and repetitive. </p>
