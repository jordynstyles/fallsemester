            <h2>Class Title</h2>
            <p>ENGL 3644</p>

            <h2>Class Description</h2>
            <p>The Postcolonial Novel is an elective class I'm taking for my English literature degree. I had taken Contemporary Fiction with thee professor before and really enjoyed it, and since I have a passive interest in postcolonial fiction, I decided to take this class. In this course, we read and write about literature in conversation with colonialism and colonial ideologies. </p>

            <h2>Professor</h2>
            <p>Dr. Weaver-Hightower</p>

            <h2>About the Professor</h2>
            <p>Dr. Rebecca Weaver-Hightower is an English Professor. She earned her BA in English from Clemson University, her MA in English from Winthrop University, and her PhD in English Literature from the University of Kentucky. Her principal research areas include postcolonial studies and settler narratives.</p>

            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <p>Because I'd taken one of Dr. Weaver-Hightower's classes before, I knew what to expect. We read, we write, we do workshops, we repeat the process. It is a structure I've really come to enjoy. While I haven't enjoyed the books we've read so far quite as much as the ones in Contemporary Fiction, it's still great literature. I have a bit of a soft spot for this class. I came to Virginia Tech as just a literature student, and over the past three years I've become a triple English student. Because of this, the number of literature classes I've taken lately has significantly dwindled. Being in this class feels like going back to my roots in a way. I'm really looking forward to seeing what the rest of the semester has to offer.</p>

            <h2>My Rating</h2>
